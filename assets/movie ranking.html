<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>This according to me is a best movie of all time and i don't know how girls are gonna feel after watching this movie but i 
    feel that every single "man" on this planet must watch this movie at least once.

<h3>Laal rang</h3>
<p>This is a movie of one of my favourite actor "Randeep Hooda".
    This movie was shoot entirely in Haryana and I think that if one's has grown up in the rural areas of Haryana then he is gonna 
    definetly gonna love this movie.

<h3>Tenet</h3>
<p>This movie is from my favourite director of all time "Christopher Nolan".
    It is basically an action-thriller and a bit of sci-fi but if you are gonna watch this movie giving your maximum amount of focus then 
    you are gonna definetly love this movie and will praise the director of the movie.
